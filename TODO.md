- add option to delete downloaded resource
- change download progress indicator to circle on the icon
- add flyout showing target time on slider
  - find some place to show the actual time, not only in-chapter time
- fix how PlayerProvider is used to play tracks, player.add() shouldn't call TrackPlayer directly but update the state and let the effects do their job
